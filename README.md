# ABI
Generate the Token ABI
If you already have a token contract address, I can help you:
Get its ABI (required for the bot to interact with it)
Verify if it's working correctly
------------------------------------------
âž¤ How to Get ABI from Remix:
Open https://remix.ethereum.org/
Load your contract (e.g., MyToken.sol)
Compile the contract
Click the "ABI" button next to the contract name in the Compilation Details
Copy the full JSON ABI
